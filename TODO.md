# Execution Journal - Development Roadmap

## Project Overview

**This is NOT the microservices saga pattern.** This system manages "loose contextual connections" between tool calls and provides a journal for recording AI decisions and actions.

## Core Concept: Execution Support, Not Execution Guarantee

This system provides **execution support** for complex tool call sequences, not automatic execution guarantees. The AI must:

- Design sequential plans and declare which steps are cancellable
- Monitor execution status
- Handle failures manually and record actions using the journal
- Consider contextual dependencies between tool calls

## Current Status

- ✅ Core tools implemented
- ✅ MCP prompts and resources
- ✅ Basic execution framework
- ✅ Database-backed journal events

## Completed Features

### 1. Plan Management
- ✅ Plan creation and storage
- ✅ Step definition with cancellability metadata
- ✅ Sequential execution planning

### 2. Execution Control
- ✅ Execution start recording
- ✅ Sequential step execution
- ✅ Status tracking and monitoring

### 3. Journal System
- ✅ Event recording for decisions
- ✅ Action logging for manual interventions
- ✅ Audit trail maintenance

### 4. Tool Integration
- ✅ MCP server setup
- ✅ Tool registration and execution
- ✅ Resource management

## Development Priorities

### Phase 1: Core Stability (Current)
- [ ] Fix any remaining import issues
- [ ] Ensure consistent terminology across all files
- [ ] Validate database schema changes
- [ ] Test all tools end-to-end

### Phase 2: Enhanced Monitoring
- [ ] Real-time execution status updates
- [ ] Better error reporting and logging
- [ ] Execution history and analytics
- [ ] Performance monitoring

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Conditional step execution
- [ ] Step retry mechanisms
- [ ] Execution templates and patterns
- [ ] Integration with external monitoring tools

## Technical Debt

### Code Quality
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Implement proper logging throughout
- [ ] Add unit tests for all components
- [ ] Performance optimization for large plans

### Documentation
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] User guides and tutorials
- [ ] Best practices documentation
- [ ] Troubleshooting guides

## Architecture Decisions

### Database Design
- **execution_instances**: Track execution state
- **execution_steps**: Individual step status
- **execution_events**: Journal of decisions and actions
- **plans**: Stored execution plans

### Execution Model
- **Sequential Only**: No parallel execution
- **No Pause/Resume**: Simplified state management
- **Journal First**: All actions recorded
- **Manual Intervention**: AI handles failures

### Tool Design
- **record_plan**: Plan creation and storage
- **record_execution_start**: Execution initiation
- **query_ledger**: Status and history querying
- **record_decision**: Decision logging
- **record_action**: Action recording

## AI Responsibilities

### 1. Plan Design
- Create sequential plans with clear dependencies
- Assign cancellability metadata to each step
- Consider failure scenarios and recovery strategies

### 2. Execution Monitoring
- Monitor execution status continuously
- Detect failures and decide on actions
- Record all decisions in the journal

### 3. Manual Intervention
- Handle failures appropriately
- Record actions taken for audit trail
- Consider contextual dependencies

## Important Notes

1. **This is NOT the MSA Saga pattern** - No automatic rollback or distributed transaction guarantees
2. **AI Responsibility** - The AI must monitor execution and record all decisions/actions
3. **Contextual Awareness** - Always consider how tool failures affect related operations
4. **Journal First** - Design plans with cancellability metadata and record all actions

## Future Considerations

### Scalability
- Support for larger execution plans
- Better performance with many concurrent executions
- Distributed execution across multiple nodes

### Integration
- Webhook support for external notifications
- API endpoints for external tool integration
- Plugin system for custom tools

### Monitoring
- Real-time dashboards
- Alert systems for failures
- Performance analytics and reporting

## Contributing

This project is designed to be simple and focused. Contributions should maintain the core principle of "execution support, not execution guarantee" while improving the user experience for AI-driven tool coordination.
