# SAGA MCP Server - Development TODO

## 🚨 **CRITICAL: Current System Limitations**

### **What This System IS:**
- ✅ **Execution Support Infrastructure**: Tools, storage, and monitoring for SAGA workflows
- ✅ **Plan Management**: Save, load, and organize execution plans
- ✅ **Basic Execution Control**: Start, pause, resume, cancel workflows
- ✅ **Status Monitoring**: Track execution progress and step results
- ✅ **Compensation Recording**: Log rollback actions (but NOT execute them)

### **What This System is NOT:**
- ❌ **Execution Guarantee System**: Does NOT automatically ensure successful completion
- ❌ **Auto-Recovery System**: Does NOT automatically handle failures or rollbacks
- ❌ **DAG Executor**: Dependencies are stored but executed sequentially
- ❌ **Intelligent Retry System**: Basic retry only, no smart failure handling

## 🎯 **AI Responsibilities (Critical for Success)**

**YOU (the AI) must:**
1. **Design Robust Plans**: Include compensation actions for every step
2. **Monitor Continuously**: Check execution status and detect failures
3. **Handle Failures Explicitly**: Call compensation tools when steps fail
4. **Manage Rollbacks**: Execute rollback operations manually
5. **Ensure Consistency**: Plan for data integrity and recovery scenarios

**The system will NOT:**
- Automatically retry failed steps
- Execute compensation actions
- Handle rollbacks automatically
- Guarantee successful completion

## 🚨 **Critical Warnings for AI Users**

### **System Limitations**
1. **No Automatic Recovery**: You must handle all failures manually
2. **Sequential Execution**: DAG dependencies are not yet executed
3. **Basic Retry Logic**: Limited automatic retry capabilities
4. **Mock Tools**: External tool execution is simulated

### **Required AI Behavior**
1. **Always Monitor**: Check execution status continuously
2. **Plan for Failure**: Include compensation actions in every plan
3. **Handle Errors**: Explicitly invoke compensation when steps fail
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate plans before execution
5. **Document Everything**: Record all decisions and actions

## 🔮 **Future Vision**

### **Phase 6: Intelligent Automation**
