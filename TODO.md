# Tool Execution Planning & Cancellation System - Development TODO

## Project Overview

This system is designed to help AI manage complex tool call sequences with contextual dependencies. It provides execution support for coordinating multiple tool calls and handling failures through manual cancellation actions.

## CRITICAL: Current System Limitations

**This is NOT the microservices saga pattern.** This system manages "loose contextual connections" between tool calls.

### What This System Actually Does
- Helps AI plan and execute sequences of tool calls
- Tracks execution progress and status
- Provides tools for manual cancellation when failures occur
- Records cancellation actions for audit trails
- Manages contextual dependencies between related operations

### What This System Does NOT Do
- No automatic rollback or compensation
- No distributed transaction guarantees
- No automatic retry mechanisms
- No parallel execution (currently sequential only)

## AI Responsibilities

1. **Plan Design**: Create robust plans with cancellation strategies
2. **Execution Monitoring**: Continuously monitor execution status
3. **Failure Handling**: Detect failures and manually invoke cancellation tools
4. **Contextual Awareness**: Consider how tool failures affect related operations
5. **Manual Cancellation**: Execute cancellation actions when needed

## Completed Features

- âœ… Basic MCP server framework
- âœ… Individual tool implementations (save_plan, execute_plan, status, control, record_compensation)
- âœ… MCP prompts for AI guidance
- âœ… MCP resources for documentation and examples
- âœ… Basic execution framework
- âœ… Tool registration and validation

## Recently Completed

- âœ… Database integration and persistence
- âœ… Plan storage and retrieval  
- âœ… Execution instance management
- âœ… Tool integration with actual database operations
- âœ… Complete execution tracking and monitoring

## Planned Features

- ðŸ“‹ Advanced DAG-based execution
- ðŸ“‹ Parallel tool execution
- ðŸ“‹ Enhanced monitoring and logging
- ðŸ“‹ Integration with external tool systems
- ðŸ“‹ Advanced cancellation strategies

## Current Architecture

### Core Components
- **Individual Tools**: Separate tools for each major function
- **Execution Manager**: Handles plan execution lifecycle
- **Database Layer**: SQLite for persistence
- **MCP Integration**: Standard MCP server with tools, prompts, and resources

### Data Flow
1. AI creates execution plan using `save_plan`
2. Plan is stored in database
3. AI executes plan using `execute_plan`
4. System tracks execution progress
5. AI monitors status using `status` tool
6. AI controls execution using `control` tool
7. AI records cancellations using `record_compensation`

## Current Status

The core system is now fully implemented and functional:

1. âœ… **Database Integration**: All tools connected to SQLite database operations
2. âœ… **Plan Persistence**: Complete plan storage and retrieval system
3. âœ… **Execution Tracking**: Full execution progress tracking and monitoring
4. âœ… **Core Error Handling**: Basic error handling and validation implemented

## Next Steps (Future Development)

1. **Enhanced Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration testing
2. **Advanced Error Recovery**: More sophisticated error handling strategies  
3. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize for large-scale operations
4. **Advanced Features**: Implement planned features below

## Success Metrics

- âœ… All tools successfully register and validate
- âœ… MCP prompts provide clear guidance
- âœ… MCP resources contain comprehensive documentation
- âœ… Server starts without errors
- âœ… Tools integrated with actual database operations
- âœ… Plan persistence and retrieval working
- âœ… Execution tracking and monitoring functional
- âœ… Database schema created and initialized

## Critical Warnings for AI Users

1. **This is NOT the MSA Saga pattern** - No automatic rollback or distributed transaction guarantees
2. **Manual Cancellation Required** - You must explicitly invoke cancellation tools when failures occur
3. **Contextual Dependencies** - Always consider how tool failures affect related operations
4. **Execution Monitoring** - Continuously monitor execution status to detect failures early
5. **Cancellation-First Design** - Design plans with cancellation strategies from the beginning

## Technical Notes

- Built with TypeScript and MCP Framework
- Uses SQLite for data persistence
- Implements standard MCP capabilities (tools, prompts, resources)
- Designed for simplicity and clarity
- Focuses on AI-driven execution management

## Future Considerations

- Parallel execution support
- Advanced dependency management
- Integration with external monitoring systems
- Enhanced error recovery mechanisms
- Performance optimization for large-scale operations
