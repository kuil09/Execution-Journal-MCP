# Tool Execution Planning (Ledger-first) - Development TODO

## Project Overview

This system is designed to help AI manage sequential tool call sequences and keep a ledger of decisions and compensations. It provides execution support for coordinating multiple tool calls and recording manual actions.

## CRITICAL: Current System Limitations

**This is NOT the microservices saga pattern.** This system manages "loose contextual connections" between tool calls.

### What This System Actually Does
- Helps AI plan and execute sequential sequences of tool calls
- Tracks execution progress and status
- Provides tools for manual action recording when failures occur
- Records compensation actions in a ledger for audit trails
- Manages contextual dependencies between related operations

### What This System Does NOT Do
- No automatic rollback or compensation
- No distributed transaction guarantees
- No automatic retry mechanisms
- No parallel execution (sequential only)
- No pause/resume functionality

## AI Responsibilities

1. **Plan Design**: Create sequential plans with cancellability metadata
2. **Execution Monitoring**: Continuously monitor execution status
3. **Failure Handling**: Detect failures and manually decide actions
4. **Contextual Awareness**: Consider how tool failures affect related operations
5. **Ledger Recording**: Record compensation actions in the ledger

## Completed Features

- âœ… Basic MCP server framework
- âœ… Individual tool implementations (save_plan, execute_plan, status, control, record_compensation)
- âœ… MCP prompts for AI guidance
- âœ… MCP resources for documentation and examples
- âœ… Basic execution framework
- âœ… Tool registration and validation

## Recently Completed

- âœ… Database integration and persistence
- âœ… Plan storage and retrieval  
- âœ… Execution instance management
- âœ… Tool integration with actual database operations
- âœ… Complete execution tracking and monitoring

## Planned Features (Simplified)

- ðŸ“‹ Enhanced monitoring and logging (sequential execution)
- ðŸ“‹ Integration with external tool systems (as needed)

## Current Architecture

### Core Components
- **Individual Tools**: Separate tools for each major function
- **Execution Manager**: Handles plan execution lifecycle
- **Database Layer**: SQLite for persistence
- **MCP Integration**: Standard MCP server with tools, prompts, and resources

### Data Flow
1. AI creates execution plan using `save_plan`
2. Plan is stored in database
3. AI executes plan using `execute_plan`
4. System tracks execution progress
5. AI monitors status using `status` tool
6. AI controls execution using `control` tool
7. AI records compensations using `record_compensation` (ledger)

## Current Status

The core system is now fully implemented and functional:

1. âœ… **Database Integration**: All tools connected to SQLite database operations
2. âœ… **Plan Persistence**: Complete plan storage and retrieval system
3. âœ… **Execution Tracking**: Full execution progress tracking and monitoring
4. âœ… **Core Error Handling**: Basic error handling and validation implemented

## Next Steps (Future Development)

1. **Enhanced Testing**: Focused unit tests for sequential execution
2. **Error Handling**: Clear failure reporting and manual recovery guidance
3. **Documentation**: Keep AI-facing guidance minimal and consistent

## Success Metrics

- âœ… All tools successfully register and validate
- âœ… MCP prompts provide clear guidance
- âœ… MCP resources contain comprehensive documentation
- âœ… Server starts without errors
- âœ… Tools integrated with actual database operations
- âœ… Plan persistence and retrieval working
- âœ… Execution tracking and monitoring functional
- âœ… Database schema created and initialized

## Critical Warnings for AI Users

1. **This is NOT the MSA Saga pattern** - No automatic rollback or distributed transaction guarantees
2. **Manual Action Required** - You must decide and execute actions when failures occur
3. **Contextual Dependencies** - Always consider how tool failures affect related operations
4. **Execution Monitoring** - Continuously monitor execution status to detect failures early
5. **Ledger-First Design** - Design plans with cancellability metadata and record actions

## Technical Notes

- Built with TypeScript and MCP Framework
- Uses SQLite for data persistence
- Implements standard MCP capabilities (tools, prompts, resources)
- Designed for simplicity and clarity
- Focuses on AI-driven execution management

## Future Considerations

- Keep scope minimal; reintroduce features only with clear demand
