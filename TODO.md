# Tool Execution Planning & Cancellation System - Development TODO

## 🚨 **CRITICAL: Current System Limitations**

### **What This System IS:**
- ✅ **Tool Execution Planning Infrastructure**: Tools, storage, and monitoring for managing tool call sequences
- ✅ **Plan Management**: Save, load, and organize tool execution plans
- ✅ **Basic Execution Control**: Start, pause, resume, cancel tool execution plans
- ✅ **Status Monitoring**: Track execution progress and tool call results
- ✅ **Compensation Recording**: Log rollback actions (but NOT execute them)

### **What This System is NOT:**
- ❌ **MSA Saga Pattern**: This is NOT the microservices saga pattern
- ❌ **Execution Guarantee System**: Does NOT automatically ensure successful completion
- ❌ **Auto-Recovery System**: Does NOT automatically handle failures or rollbacks
- ❌ **Parallel Executor**: Tools are called sequentially (no parallel execution yet)
- ❌ **Intelligent Retry System**: Basic retry only, no smart failure handling

## 🎯 **AI Responsibilities (Critical for Success)**

**YOU (the AI) must:**
1. **Design Robust Plans**: Include compensation actions for every tool call
2. **Monitor Continuously**: Check execution status and detect failures
3. **Handle Failures Explicitly**: Call cancellation/compensation tools when tool calls fail
4. **Manage Rollbacks**: Execute rollback operations manually
5. **Ensure Consistency**: Plan for data integrity and recovery scenarios

**The system will NOT:**
- Automatically retry failed tool calls
- Execute compensation actions
- Handle rollbacks automatically
- Guarantee successful completion

## 🚨 **Critical Warnings for AI Users**

### **System Limitations**
1. **No Automatic Recovery**: You must handle all failures manually
2. **Sequential Execution**: Tools are called one after another
3. **Basic Retry Logic**: Limited automatic retry capabilities
4. **Mock Tools**: External tool execution is simulated

### **Required AI Behavior**
1. **Always Monitor**: Check execution status continuously
2. **Plan for Failure**: Include compensation actions in every plan
3. **Handle Errors**: Explicitly invoke cancellation when tool calls fail
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate plans before execution
5. **Document Everything**: Record all decisions and actions

**Remember**: This system is designed to support your tool execution planning and management, not to guarantee it. Success depends on your careful planning, monitoring, and failure handling. This is NOT the MSA saga pattern - it's a tool execution planning system.
