## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: System Limitations & AI Responsibilities

### What This System IS:
- **Tool Execution Planning Infrastructure**: Tools, storage, and monitoring for managing tool call sequences
- **Plan Management**: Save, load, and organize tool execution plans
- **Basic Execution Control**: Start, pause, resume, cancel tool execution plans
- **Status Monitoring**: Track execution progress and tool call results
- **Compensation Recording**: Log rollback actions (but NOT execute them)

### What This System is NOT:
- **MSA Saga Pattern**: This is NOT the microservices saga pattern
- **Execution Guarantee System**: Does NOT automatically ensure successful completion
- **Auto-Recovery System**: Does NOT automatically handle failures or rollbacks
- **Parallel Executor**: Tools are called sequentially (no parallel execution yet)
- **Intelligent Retry System**: Basic retry only, no smart failure handling

## Key Concepts
- **Execution Support, Not Execution Guarantee**: The system provides tools and infrastructure for robust tool execution planning, but AI must design resilient plans
- **Compensation-First Design**: Every tool call should have a corresponding compensation action
- **Failure Handling**: AI must explicitly handle failures and invoke cancellation/compensation tools
- **Sequential Execution**: Tools are called one after another (parallel execution planned for future)

## AI Responsibilities (Critical for Success)

### 1. Plan Design
- Create comprehensive plans with clear tool call sequences
- Define compensation actions for each tool call
- Consider failure scenarios and cancellation strategies
- Plan for manual intervention when tool calls fail

### 2. Failure Handling
- Monitor execution status continuously
- Detect when tool calls fail or timeout
- Explicitly call cancellation tools when needed
- Decide when to pause, resume, or cancel

### 3. Compensation Management
- Record compensation actions using record_compensation
- Execute rollback operations manually
- Ensure data consistency through proper planning
- Document what was undone and why

## Usage Guidelines
1. Always design plans with failure scenarios in mind
2. Include compensation actions for every tool call
3. Test your plans with the available tools
4. Monitor execution status and handle failures gracefully
5. Be prepared to manually intervene when failures occur

## Current Limitations
- **Sequential Execution**: Tools are called one after another (no parallel execution yet)
- **Auto-compensation**: Not implemented - AI must handle manually
- **Retry Logic**: Basic retry in tool coordinator only
- **Mock Tools**: Tools are simulated, not real external services

## What AI Should Know
1. **This is a tool execution planning and management system**
2. **You design the plans and handle failures**
3. **Cancellation and compensation must be explicitly invoked**
4. **Monitor execution status continuously**
5. **Use the provided tools to manage your tool call sequences**
6. **Success depends on your careful planning and monitoring**
7. **This is NOT the MSA Saga pattern - it's a tool execution planning system**
